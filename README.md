**Demo Site:** https://cywf.github.io/willow

The demo site runs in demo mode showing sample properties. To interact with the blockchain features, install MetaMask and connect to a local Hardhat network.

## Technology Stack & Tools

- Solidity (Writing Smart Contracts & Tests)
- Javascript (React & Testing)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) (Development Framework)
- [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) (Blockchain Interaction)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) (Frontend Framework)

- (Optional) Install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension for blockchain interaction

## Setting Up
### 1. Clone/Download the Repository

### 2. Install Dependencies:
`$ npm install`

### 3. Run tests
`$ npx hardhat test`

### 4. Start Hardhat node
`$ npx hardhat node`

### 5. Run deployment script
